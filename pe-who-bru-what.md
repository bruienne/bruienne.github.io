## Pe-who? Bru-what?

With my name being half-Dutch and half-French it's not doing native English speaker any favors trying to pronounce it. So by popular demand I'll try to help those who care enough to pronounce my name right.  

- **Puh \*\*- \*\*pine** (like the tree)  
- **Brie** (like the cheese) - **yen**. And there it is. Now I'll know you're not a telemarketer when we speak in person. Â
