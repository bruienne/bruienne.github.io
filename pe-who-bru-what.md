## Pe-who? Bru-what?

With my name being half-Dutch and half-French it's not doing native English speaker any favors trying to pronounce it. So by popular demand I'll try to help those who care enough to pronounce my name right.  

- **Puh** - **pine** (like the tree)  
- **Brie** (like the cheese) - **yen** (like the currency)

Or, if you're a visual person, here's a handy mnemonic to remember it by:

And there it is. Now I'll know you're not a telemarketer when we speak in person.
