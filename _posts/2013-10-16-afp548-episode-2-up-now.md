I recently casted pod for the fine folks at AFP548 and had the privilege of talking to the esteemed [Charles Edge](http://krypted.com/) for an hour and change. Go check it out [here](http://bit.ly/16aomNN).

Thanks to [Charles](https://twitter.com/cedge318) and [Allister](https://twitter.com/sacrilicious) for their direct involvement and the AFP548 [purveyors](http://www.afp548.com/about-afp548/) at large for having me. It was a blast!

Edit: if iTunes seems wonky, [this][1] is the direct link to the episode on SoundCloud.
