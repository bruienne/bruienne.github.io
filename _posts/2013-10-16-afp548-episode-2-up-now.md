I recently casted pod for the fine folks at AFP548 and had the privilege of talking to the esteemed <a href="http://krypted.com/" target="_blank">Charles Edge</a> for an hour and change. Go check it out <a href="http://bit.ly/16aomNN" target="_blank">here</a>. Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/cedge318" target="_blank">Charles</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/sacrilicious" target="_blank">Allister</a> for their direct involvement and the AFP548 <a href="http://www.afp548.com/about-afp548/" target="_blank">purveyors</a> at large for having me. It was a blast! Edit: if iTunes seems wonky, [this][1] is the direct link to the episode on SoundCloud.
