Opinions are plentiful and often wrong, so I never blogged anything. Having enjoyed a fair amount of tech-oriented blogs over the years I've come to appreciate them for providing both quickly jotted down <a href="http://managingosx.wordpress.com/2012/02/16/public-service-announcement/" target="_blank">notes</a> and elaborate <a href="http://derflounder.wordpress.com/2012/02/24/setting-up-cauliflower-vest-using-a-google-apps-domain/" target="_blank">technical writeups</a>. With that purpose in mind I'm going to start writing down some of my own notes and findings, if only to save them for future reference. In the process others may find what I come up with helpful (or completely ridiculous) but I'll leave that up to the reader. Onward!
