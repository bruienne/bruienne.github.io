I spoke at MacTech Conference 2014 about Docker earlier this week, the slides for which are now up at <a href="https://db.tt/mSWzOHnb" title="https://db.tt/mSWzOHnb" target="_blank">https://db.tt/mSWzOHnb</a>

In the talk I cover Docker and application containerization specific to Mac admins. The content is purposely not an all-encompassing dive into Docker but aims to introduce Mac admins to the concept of containerization and how it makes their lives easier deploying Mac management-centric services.

Thanks to everyone who showed up and asked questions during my talk. The MacTech Conference organization usually also makes the session videos available, for a fee. I am not involved in the sale of the videos so check out the <a href="http://www.mactech.com/conference/videos" title="Conference video page" target="_blank">Conference video page</a> after the Conference to find out more.
