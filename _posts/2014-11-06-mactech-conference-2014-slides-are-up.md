I spoke at MacTech Conference 2014 about Docker earlier this week, the slides for which are now up at [https://db.tt/mSWzOHnb](https://db.tt/mSWzOHnb)

In the talk I cover Docker and application containerization specific to Mac admins. The content is purposely not an all-encompassing dive into Docker but aims to introduce Mac admins to the concept of containerization and how it makes their lives easier deploying Mac management-centric services.

Thanks to everyone who showed up and asked questions during my talk. The MacTech Conference organization usually also makes the session videos available, for a fee. I am not involved in the sale of the videos so check out the [Conference video page](http://www.mactech.com/conference/videos) after the Conference to find out more.
