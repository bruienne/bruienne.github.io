Nick McSpadden wrote up a helpful <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/macenterprise/browse_thread/thread/614aab9bde90485a#" target="_blank">step-by-step guide</a> on how to configure Firefox 10 ESR using CCK Wizard while nixing any and all user-facing notifications. The attentive reader will notice that it takes quite a few steps to get to where you want to be with Firefox. Mozilla is not doing any Enterprise/Edu admin any favors with this added complexity.
