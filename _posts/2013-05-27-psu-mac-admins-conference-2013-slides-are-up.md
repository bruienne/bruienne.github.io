First of all I want to thank all those brave souls who stuck around until this year's conference's bitter end to come to listen to me talk about Munki, Munkiserver, Puppet and the combination of the three. The video of mine and other speaker's sessions can be found on the [PSU Mac Admins YouTube page](http://www.youtube.com/user/psumacconf) somewhere in the latter part of June.

After some minor modifications (thanks @Allister) I have posted my slide deck as a PDF. The PSU folks will also be sending out links to attendees of the slides of all the other speakers.

However if you did not attend the conference you can find my slides right [here](http://bit.ly/10vYCqn).

Many thanks to the PSU Mac Admins team for organizing a well-oiled conference, it was a blast!
