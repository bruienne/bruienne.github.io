***Update**: since the details that we received did not line up with Creative Cloud Enterprise features I asked for verification from our vendor whether we were given details about the CC  Enterprise product and whether it was given by an Adobe rep. Neither were the case, so I am modifying my post to instead outline the details of the **Creative Cloud for Teams** program for those SMB admins who are considering it for their users.* *I apologize for any confusion the initial post created, it was by no means my intention to do so. A big thanks to Jody Rogers for alerting me about the misinformation. As always he is on top of things.* **Adobe Creative Cloud for Teams** highlights: 
*   For those with security policies that forbid Cloud storage use, <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/creativecloud/faq.html#storage-services" target="_blank">Creative Cloud storage</a> must be blocked through **firewall port filtering** at the customer's site.
*   <a href="http://helpx.adobe.com/creative-cloud/packager.html" target="_blank">Creative Cloud Packager</a> currently does not have a "kill switch" for the CC storage functionality, as it has for **EULA suppression**, **update notifications**, etc.
*   Laptop users who use the CC apps at home or anywhere else that is not at their employer's location will have **full access** to CC storage.
*   CC Teams admins have the ability to **see which users are using CC storage** and must police this usage themselves.
*   The ability to retrieve any CC-stored content for users who have been removed from the company's CC account is in the works.
*   Upon first time deployment of one or more CC apps the end user **must register an Adobe ID** to then validate the app(s) they were given access to. CC Teams admins must **generate email notifications **for **each new user** (and likely also for **each new app** assigned to an existing user).
*   A user's computer must make contact with the Adobe CC servers at least **once every 30 days** or the installed CC app(s) will revert to** trial mode**.
*   As far as I could understand there's still the dual-license ability where a user can use the same applications they are licensed for on a desktop and a laptop computer. No clear word on whether this means simultaneously or not.
*   For those of us who need to test **deployment**, **security** or **end-user** functionality Adobe can decide to make short-term (think **3-4 weeks**) licenses available. These are all the points I got out of our 45 minute call. Anyone out there who has more solid details that either confirm or contradict any of the information presented here is encouraged to respond in the comments, email or Twitter.
