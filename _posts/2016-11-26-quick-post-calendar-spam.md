## Quick Post - iCloud calendar spam

Since iCloud calendar spam suddenly appears to be [a thing](https://twitter.com/bruienne/status/802174492000874496) and a bunch of folks both [asked](https://twitter.com/latteine/status/802192190168567808) me about it and offered [possible solutions](https://twitter.com/swy/status/802263392027283456) I whipped up a quick infographic on how to deal with it, or at least how to make it less annoying by being able to filter it.

### What's this anyway?
By default iCloud automatically adds calendar invites to a user's pending events list, generally a good thing if someone wants to genuinely invite you to a meeting or some other event. As with anything else that involves computers, someone figured out that this would also make a fine way to advertise their fine knock-off watches, sunglasses and other merchandise by mass-sending calendar invites that include links of varying degrees of ill repute.

### Just stop.
Agreed. So to wrap up other more long-winded explanations on how to do this I whipped out trusty Preview.app (in keeping with my stdlib or GTFO credo) and put together the following Twitter-friendly graphical how-to.
