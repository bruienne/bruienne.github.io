The slides for the two talks I gave at this year's PSU Mac Admins Conference are now available as PDFs at these links:

[Free your Netboot server with BSDPy](https://www.dropbox.com/s/64ntuop7gpzi0if/Free_your_Netboot_server_with_BSDPy.pdf?dl=0)  
[Connect the dots with Docker](https://www.dropbox.com/s/xbqja4irxldrrgl/Connect_the_dots_with_Docker.pdf?dl=0)

Thanks to all attendees that showed up for either one or both of my talks, hope to see you all again next year!
