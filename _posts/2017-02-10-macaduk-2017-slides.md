## Mac AD UK 2017 slides are available

Another fantastic edition of the Mac Admins and Developers UK Conference (or MacADUK 2017 for short) has come to an end. With an improved venue and great speaker lineup I very much enjoyed meeting up with and speaking to fellow Mac admins to hear their stories and learn from them.

My talk this year focused on the changed landscape in security for Mac admins. No longer is it sufficient to just run a very tight ship on the admin's end, but instead concepts like security hygiene and endpoint risk are playing a much bigger role in assuring your organization does not become another data breach statistic.

While we were all together in one place the hosts of the [Macadmins.org Podcast](http://podcast.macadmins.org) also found some time to record a special live episode, courtesy of Charles Edge's hotel room and with special guests Henry Stamerjohann and Ã‰ric Falconnier who represented Zentral and Richard Purves who spoke about all things SmartCard on macOS. Do yourself a favor and [go listen to the episode first](http://podcast.macadmins.org/2017/02/10/episode-23-live-at-mac-ad-uk-with-henry-stamerjohann-eric-falconnier-and-richard-purves/), then read through my slides.

A huge THANK YOU to the conference organizers and the entire team that made this year another success, I am honored to have been allowed to speak again.
