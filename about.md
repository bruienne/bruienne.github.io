Thanks for visiting my personal tech blog, Enterprise Mac.

My name is Pepijn Bruienne and I'm a Mac Admin at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, MI. All opinions expressed on this blog are mine and not those of my employer.

On this blow I write infrequent pieces about Mac in the Enterprise topics, things I've figured out, bugs I encountered, or links to items of interest written by others.

I also try to post speaker slides and videos for talks I've given at Mac-related conferences in the past.

Enjoy!
